# MT5 Rates HTTP Provider

This code serves as a sample implementation of the MT5 Rates HTTP Provider, which is a tool used to retrieve historical rates data for specified symbols and timeframes in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/mt5-rates-http-provider-reliable-forex-data-review/).

## Usage

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Include the necessary libraries by adding `#include <Wininet.mqh>` at the beginning of your code.

2. Define the constant `HTTP_TIMEOUT` to specify the HTTP request timeout in milliseconds.

3. Implement the `OnInit()` function to initialize the Wininet library. This function opens a connection to the internet using the `InternetOpen()` function. If the initialization fails, an error message is printed and the initialization is considered failed.

4. Implement the `OnDeinit(const int reason)` function to close the Wininet library. This function closes the connection to the internet using the `InternetCloseHandle()` function.

5. Implement the `OnTick()` function as the entry point for your expert advisor. Inside this function, you can perform any data retrieval functions. In the provided example, the function calls `RetrieveHistoricalData()` to retrieve historical rates data for the 'EURUSD' symbol and the daily timeframe (PERIOD_D1).

6. Implement the `RetrieveHistoricalData(string symbol, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES timeframe)` function to construct the HTTP request URL, send the HTTP request, and process the response. This function takes the symbol and timeframe as parameters, constructs the URL, and calls `SendHttpRequest()` to send the HTTP request. The response is then processed and checked for success or failure.

7. Implement the `SendHttpRequest(string url)` function to send the HTTP request to the specified URL and read the response. This function opens the HTTP connection using `InternetOpenUrl()`, reads the response using `InternetReadFile()`, and appends the response to a string. Finally, the HTTP connection is closed using `InternetCloseHandle()`.
